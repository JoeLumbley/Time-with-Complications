## Code Walkthrough

```vb
Public Class Form1
```
- This line defines a new class called `Form1`, which represents the main window of the application.

```vb
  Private Context As BufferedGraphicsContext
  Private Buffer As BufferedGraphics
```
- Here, we declare two private variables: `Context` to manage graphics rendering and `Buffer` to hold the graphics that will be drawn on the screen.

```vb
  Private Enum HourFormat
    Twelve
    TwentyFour
  End Enum
```
- This creates an enumeration named `HourFormat` with two possible values: `Twelve` for 12-hour time and `TwentyFour` for 24-hour time.

```vb
  Private Hours As HourFormat = HourFormat.Twelve
```
- This line initializes a variable `Hours` to `HourFormat.Twelve`, meaning the app will start in 12-hour format.

```vb
  Private Enum InfoType
    Time
    LongDayOfWeek
    ShortDayOfWeek
    LongDate
    MedDate
    ShortDate
    TimeZone
    TimeZoneCity
    LocalTime
    MilitaryDate
  End Enum
```
- This defines another enumeration called `InfoType`, which lists different types of information that can be displayed (like time, date, and time zone).

```vb
  Private Structure DisplayObject
    Public Location As Point
    Public Text As String
    Public Font As Font
    Public Type As InfoType
  End Structure
```
- This creates a structure named `DisplayObject` that holds information about what to display on the screen. It includes the location of the text, the text itself, the font used, and the type of information.

```vb
  Private MainDisplay As DisplayObject
  Private TopDisplay As DisplayObject
  Private BottomDisplay As DisplayObject
```
- These lines declare three instances of `DisplayObject` for the main display (time), top display (day/date), and bottom display (additional info).

```vb
  Private ReadOnly AlineCenterMiddle As New StringFormat With {.Alignment = StringAlignment.Center, .LineAlignment = StringAlignment.Center}
```
- This creates a `StringFormat` object that centers text both horizontally and vertically.

### Form Load Event

```vb
  Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
```
- This is an event handler that runs when the form is loaded.

```vb
    InitializeForm()
    InitializeBuffer()
```
- These calls initialize the form's settings and the graphics buffer.

```vb
    TopDisplay.Type = InfoType.LongDayOfWeek
    BottomDisplay.Type = InfoType.MedDate
```
- Here, we set the types of information to display in the top and bottom displays.

```vb
    Timer1.Interval = 20
    Timer1.Enabled = True
```
- This sets a timer to update the displays every 20 milliseconds and enables it.

```vb
    Debug.Print($"Program running... {Now.ToShortTimeString()}")
```
- This prints a message to the debug console showing the current time when the program starts.

### Form Resize Event

```vb
  Private Sub Form1_Resize(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Resize
```
- This event handler runs when the form is resized.

```vb
    If Not WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized Then
```
- This checks if the window is not minimized.

```vb
      Dim FontSize As Integer = ClientSize.Width \ 14
```
- This calculates the font size based on the width of the form.

```vb
      MainDisplay.Font = New Font("Segoe UI", FontSize, FontStyle.Regular)
```
- This sets the font for the main display using the calculated size.

```vb
      MainDisplay.Location.X = ClientSize.Width \ 2
      MainDisplay.Location.Y = (ClientSize.Height + MenuStrip1.Height) \ 2
```
- These lines center the main display in the form.

```vb
      TopDisplay.Location.X = ClientSize.Width \ 2
      TopDisplay.Location.Y = (ClientSize.Height + MenuStrip1.Height) \ 2 - ClientSize.Width \ 10

      BottomDisplay.Location.X = ClientSize.Width \ 2
      BottomDisplay.Location.Y = (ClientSize.Height + MenuStrip1.Height) \ 2 + ClientSize.Width \ 10

```
- The same logic is applied to position the top and bottom displays.

```vb
      If Buffer IsNot Nothing Then
        Buffer.Dispose()
        Buffer = Nothing
      End If
```
- This checks if the buffer exists and disposes of it to free up resources.

### Timer Tick Event

```vb
  Private Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick
```
- This event runs every time the timer ticks.

```vb
    UpdateDisplays()
```
- This calls a method to update the text displayed on the screen.

```vb
    If Not WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized Then
      Refresh() ' Calls OnPaint Sub
    End If
```
- If the window is not minimized, it refreshes the display to show updated information.

### OnPaint Event

```vb
  Protected Overrides Sub OnPaint(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)
```
- This is where the drawing happens. It overrides the default paint behavior.

```vb
    If Buffer Is Nothing Then
      Buffer = Context.Allocate(e.Graphics, ClientRectangle)
    End If
```
- If the buffer does not exist, it allocates a new one.

```vb
    DrawDisplays()
    Buffer.Render(e.Graphics)
```
- Calls a method to draw the displays and then renders the buffer onto the screen.

### Update Displays Method

```vb
  Private Sub UpdateDisplays()
    UpdateMainDisplay()
    UpdateTopDisplay()
    UpdateBottomDisplay()
  End Sub
```
- This method updates all the display areas by calling their respective update methods.

### Draw Displays Method

```vb
  Private Sub DrawDisplays()
```
- This method handles the actual drawing of the text on the screen.

```vb
    If Buffer IsNot Nothing Then
        Try
            With Buffer.Graphics
                .Clear(Color.Black) ' Clear the buffer with a black background
                .CompositingMode = Drawing2D.CompositingMode.SourceOver
                .TextRenderingHint = Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint.AntiAlias
                .SmoothingMode = Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.HighQuality
                .PixelOffsetMode = Drawing2D.PixelOffsetMode.None
                .CompositingQuality = Drawing2D.CompositingQuality.HighQuality
```
- It checks if the buffer exists, clears it with a black background, and sets various graphics quality options.

```vb
                .DrawString(MainDisplay.Text, MainDisplay.Font, Brushes.White, MainDisplay.Location, AlineCenterMiddle)
                .DrawString(TopDisplay.Text, TopDisplay.Font, Brushes.LightGray, TopDisplay.Location, AlineCenterMiddle)
                .DrawString(BottomDisplay.Text, BottomDisplay.Font, Brushes.LightGray, BottomDisplay.Location, AlineCenterMiddle)
```
- This draws the main, top, and bottom display texts using their respective fonts and colors.







### UpdateMainDisplay Method

```vb
  Private Sub UpdateMainDisplay()
```
- This line defines a new method called `UpdateMainDisplay`. This method is responsible for updating the text displayed in the main display area of the application, which typically shows the current time.

```vb
    Select Case Hours
```
- Here, we start a `Select Case` statement to evaluate the `Hours` variable. This variable indicates whether the application is set to display time in 12-hour or 24-hour format.

```vb
      Case HourFormat.Twelve
```
- If `Hours` is set to `HourFormat.Twelve`, this block executes, meaning we will format the time in a 12-hour format.

```vb
        MainDisplay.Text = Now.ToShortTimeString()


```
- This line sets `MainDisplay.Text` to the current time formatted as hours and minutes in 12-hour format (e.g., "3:45 PM"). 

```vb
      Case HourFormat.TwentyFour
```
- If `Hours` is set to `HourFormat.TwentyFour`, this block executes, meaning we will format the time in a 24-hour format.

```vb
        MainDisplay.Text = Now.ToString("HH:mm")
```
- This line sets `MainDisplay.Text` to the current time formatted as hours and minutes in 24-hour format (e.g., "15:45").

```vb
    End Select
End Sub
```
- The `End Select` statement closes the `Select Case` block, and `End Sub` marks the end of the `UpdateMainDisplay` method.



The `UpdateMainDisplay` method updates the text displayed in the main section of the application based on the current time format (12-hour or 24-hour) specified by the `Hours` variable. 

- If the application is in 12-hour mode, it formats the time to include AM/PM.
- If itâ€™s in 24-hour mode, it displays the time in a 24-hour format.

This method ensures that the user sees the current time in their preferred format. 




### UpdateTopDisplay Method

```vb
  Private Sub UpdateTopDisplay()
```
- This line defines a new method called `UpdateTopDisplay`. This method is responsible for updating the text displayed in the top display area of the application.

```vb
    Select Case TopDisplay.Type
```
- Here, we start a `Select Case` statement. This allows us to evaluate the `TopDisplay.Type` to determine what kind of information we need to show in the top display.

```vb
      Case InfoType.LongDayOfWeek
        TopDisplay.Text = Now.DayOfWeek.ToString
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.LongDayOfWeek`, this line sets `TopDisplay.Text` to the full name of the current day of the week (e.g., "Monday"). `Now.DayOfWeek` gets the current day, and `ToString` converts it to a readable format.

```vb
      Case InfoType.ShortDayOfWeek
        TopDisplay.Text = GetDayOfWeekAbbreviation(Now.DayOfWeek)
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.ShortDayOfWeek`, this line calls the `GetDayOfWeekAbbreviation` function, passing the current day of the week. This function returns a three-letter abbreviation (e.g., "Mon" for Monday).

```vb
      Case InfoType.LongDate
        TopDisplay.Text = Now.ToLongDateString
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.LongDate`, this line sets `TopDisplay.Text` to the long date format (e.g., "Monday, November 19, 2024") using `Now.ToLongDateString`.

```vb
      Case InfoType.MedDate
        TopDisplay.Text = Now.ToString("MMMM d, yyyy")
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.MedDate`, this line formats the date in a medium style (e.g., "November 19, 2024") and assigns it to `TopDisplay.Text`.

```vb
      Case InfoType.ShortDate
        TopDisplay.Text = Now.ToShortDateString
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.ShortDate`, this line sets `TopDisplay.Text` to a short date format (e.g., "11/19/2024").

```vb
      Case InfoType.MilitaryDate
        TopDisplay.Text = Now.ToString("ddMMMyy").ToUpper()
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.MilitaryDate`, this formats the date in a military style (e.g., "19NOV24") and converts it to uppercase.

```vb
      Case InfoType.TimeZone
        TopDisplay.Text = TimeZoneInfo.Local.Id
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.TimeZone`, this line sets `TopDisplay.Text` to the ID of the local time zone (e.g., "Pacific Standard Time").

```vb
      Case InfoType.TimeZoneCity
        TopDisplay.Text = GetTimeZoneCity(TimeZoneInfo.Local.Id)
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.TimeZoneCity`, this line calls the `GetTimeZoneCity` function, passing the local time zone ID. This function returns the name of a city associated with that time zone (e.g., "Los Angeles" for Pacific Standard Time).

```vb
      Case InfoType.LocalTime
        TopDisplay.Text = "Local Time"
```
- If `TopDisplay.Type` is `InfoType.LocalTime`, this line simply sets `TopDisplay.Text` to the string "Local Time".

```vb
    End Select
  End Sub
```
- The `End Select` statement closes the `Select Case` block, and `End Sub` marks the end of the `UpdateTopDisplay` method.


The `UpdateTopDisplay` method dynamically updates the text displayed in the top section of the application based on the type of information specified in `TopDisplay.Type`. It uses the `Select Case` statement to check the type and assigns the appropriate value to `TopDisplay.Text`. This allows the application to show different types of information, such as the current day, date, or time zone, depending on user preferences. 










### Update Bottom Display Method

```vb
  Private Sub UpdateBottomDisplay()
    Select Case BottomDisplay.Type
```
- This method updates the text for the bottom display based on its type.

```vb
      Case InfoType.LongDayOfWeek
        BottomDisplay.Text = Now.DayOfWeek.ToString
    ' Other cases for different types...
    End Select
  End Sub
```
- Depending on the type of information, it sets the text to the current day of the week, date, time zone, etc.



This code creates a simple time display application that updates in real-time. It uses Windows Forms and VB.NET to manage graphics and handle user interactions. Each part of the code is designed to ensure that the display updates smoothly and provides relevant information to the user.
